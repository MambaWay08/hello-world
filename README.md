A Celebration of Life - In Memory of Mr. Kobe Bryant.
This is Wei Li, a fan of Kobe Bryant. 
I renamed my nickname as MambaWay08, While Mamba stands for Kobe, Way for me myself, 08 for Kobe's Jersey Number as well as Kobe and my birth month - August.
On June 29th 2020, I create this GitHub account to start a completely new journey on Coding.
Have fun.
