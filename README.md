A Celebration of Life - In Memory of Kobe Bryant.

This is Wei Li from Hangzhou CHN. I renamed my nickname as MambaWay08 in order to memorize the NBA GOAT Kobe Bryant.
Mamba is the nickname of Kobe, while Way is the same pronunciation as Wei.
08 stands not only for Kobe's jersey number but also for both his birth month and mine - the August.

I have pretty little experience in coding in the past 35 years, and I deceide to create this GitHub account MambaWay08 for purpose of seeking for an alternative way to saving my mid-life crisis without Dear Basketball and Dear Kobe.

Hello World!
