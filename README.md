A Celebration of Life - In Memory of Mr. Kobe Bryant.
This is Wei Li, a fan of Kobe Bryant. 
I renamed my nickname as MambaWay08. 
- Mamba stands for Kobe.
- Way for me myself.
- 08 for Kobe's Jersey Number, as well as for August, on which month Kobe and I were born.

On June 29th 2020, I create this GitHub account to start a completely new journey on Coding, a field I never tried.
The most important purpose is, I am seeking for something attractive to my boring mid-life alternative to Dear Basketball.
Have fun.
