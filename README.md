A Celebration of Life - In Memory of Kobe Bryant.
This is Wei Li from Hangzhou. 
I renamed my nickname as MambaWay08 in order to memorize the GOAT Kobe Bryant.
Mamba is the nickname of kobe, While Way is the same pronuciation as Wei.
08 stands not only for Kobe's jersey number but also his and my birth month - August.
I create this GitHub account just to seek for an alternative way of saving my mid-life crisis especially without Dear Basketball and Dear Kobe.
Hope this could be a good start of a compeletely new journey in the next few years. 
Hello World!
